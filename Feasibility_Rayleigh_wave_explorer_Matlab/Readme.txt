The article focuses on a practical example of Programming in Geoscience. The feasibility of a Rayleigh wave explorer is tested and implemented with Matlab.

The first script, Rayleigh_explorer, is used to create an image of the elliptical polarization of a Rayleigh wave generated by two harmonic curves with a phase difference between them (assuming propagation in a half-homogeneous space). This script allows the user to modify the input parameters, such as amplitude, frequency, phase, time sampling, and hence to visualize a different image or behavior in the polarization. 

A second script is tested with the main purpose of visualizing the ground motion solicited by a Rayleigh oscillation focusing on the rotation direction. Though the user can freely change the input parameters as previously, two usage modes are suggested: input positive and negative phase differences between the two harmonics. It is clear that the rotation direction will be strongly influenced by the sign of the phase difference, as already proved by published eminent works in wave polarization. 

As a final result, the user will have an approximate idea of how a Rayleigh wave propagates and the 'sense' of the motion, sea-wave-like, on a free surface.

The take-home message of these scripts is to model a physical phenomenon, by using a programming language, to visualize and understand it.
